# Registry Failover Configuration
# Controls retry logic, health monitoring, and circuit breaker behavior

# Retry Configuration
retry:
  max_retries: 3                # Maximum retry attempts per registry
  retry_delay: 1.0              # Initial delay between retries (seconds)
  max_retry_delay: 30.0         # Maximum delay between retries (seconds)
  backoff_multiplier: 2.0       # Exponential backoff multiplier

# Health Monitoring
health:
  check_interval: 60            # Health check interval (seconds)
  timeout: 30.0                 # Request timeout (seconds)
  
# Circuit Breaker Configuration
circuit_breaker:
  failure_threshold: 5          # Failures before opening circuit breaker
  reset_time: 300              # Time before attempting to reset (seconds)
  
# Performance Thresholds
performance:
  healthy_response_time: 2.0    # Response time for "healthy" status (seconds)
  degraded_response_time: 10.0  # Response time for "degraded" status (seconds)
  
# Logging Configuration
logging:
  enable_metrics_logging: true  # Log performance metrics
  enable_failover_logging: true # Log failover events
  log_level: "INFO"            # Log level for failover events

# Advanced Settings
advanced:
  enable_circuit_breaker: true  # Enable/disable circuit breaker functionality
  enable_health_checks: true    # Enable/disable automatic health checks
  parallel_requests: false      # Execute registry requests in parallel
  cache_health_results: true    # Cache health check results
